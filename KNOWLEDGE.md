- **Vote Management**: Users can change or remove votes
- **Real-time Updates**: Vote counts update instantly across all users
- **Group-filtered Voting**: Votes can be filtered by group membership
- **Weighted Scoring**: Popularity calculated as `(2 Ã— Must Go) + Interested`

### 3. Group System

- **Role-based Permissions**: Different access levels for Core team vs regular users

### 6. Filtering & Discovery
- **Multiple Filter Types**:
  - Music Genre filtering
  - Stage filtering  
  - Minimum rating threshold
  - Group membership filtering
- **Sorting Options**:
  - Alphabetical (A-Z, Z-A)
  - Rating (highest first)
  - Popularity (weighted score)
  - Performance date
- **View Modes**: Grid view (cards) and List view
- **Real-time Search**: Instant filtering and sorting

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **artists**: Artist information (name, genre, stage, URLs, images, metadata)
- **votes**: User voting records with vote types and timestamps
- **artist_notes**: Collaborative notes about artists
- **artist_knowledge**: User's familiarity tracking with artists
- **music_genres**: Genre taxonomy for categorization

### Group System Tables
- **groups**: Voting groups with creators and metadata
- **group_members**: Group membership with roles and join dates
- **group_invites**: Secure invitation system with tokens and expiration

### User System Tables
- **profiles**: Extended user information beyond Supabase auth
- User authentication handled by Supabase's `auth.users` table

### Key Relationships
- Artists belong to genres (many-to-one)
- Votes link users to artists with vote types
- Notes connect users and artists with group visibility
- Groups contain multiple members with role-based permissions
- Invites enable secure group joining

## User Experience

### Key UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancement
- **Dark Theme**: Purple/blue gradient design optimized for festival branding
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant vote updates and live collaboration
- **Intuitive Voting**: Clear visual feedback for vote states and counts

- Group management interface for creators
- Profile management for user settings

### Visual Design
- Festival-themed purple/blue gradient backgrounds
- Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur effects

## Security Model

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Artists**: Public read access, authenticated creation, Core team editing
- **Votes**: Public read, users can only manage their own votes  
- **Notes**: Group-based visibility and editing permissions
- **Groups**: Members can view, creators can manage
- **Profiles**: Public read access, users manage their own profiles

### Authentication Security
- Magic link authentication for secure, passwordless access
- OTP verification as backup authentication method
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Invite token validation with expiration and usage limits

### Permission Levels
1. **Anonymous**: View artists and votes only
2. **Authenticated**: Full voting, note creation, group participation
3. **Group Creators**: Manage their groups and invitations
4. **Core Team**: Add/edit artists, administrative functions

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **Spotify**: Artist profile links and metadata
- **SoundCloud**: Alternative music platform integration
- **Email Service**: Magic link and OTP delivery via Supabase

### Real-time Features
- Vote updates broadcast instantly
- Artist additions/changes propagated live
- Group membership changes reflected immediately
- Notes visible to group members in real-time

## Development Patterns

### Code Organization
- **Custom Hooks**: Separated business logic (useAuth, useVoting, useGroups)
- **Query Management**: TanStack Query for server state with real-time subscriptions
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable UI components with clear prop interfaces
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Supabase type generation

### State Management Strategy
- Server state via TanStack Query with optimistic updates
- URL state for filters and navigation
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Real-time subscriptions for live data updates

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for artist images with fallbacks
- Optimistic updates for voting interactions
- Debounced search and filtering
- Efficient real-time subscription management

## Technical Debt & Considerations

### Current Architecture Decisions
- Using magic link auth instead of social providers for simplicity
- Real-time updates via Supabase channels instead of polling
- Group-based permissions instead of complex role hierarchies
- Soft deletion for artists to preserve historical data

### Scalability Considerations
- Database queries optimized for group-filtered views
- Efficient real-time subscription patterns
- Image optimization and CDN considerations for artist photos
- Query caching strategies for frequently accessed data
